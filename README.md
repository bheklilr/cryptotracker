# cryptotracker

A simple electron style app to help you track the total value of your various
cryptocurriences.

## Motivation

I want to use this project as a learning exercise, and I'd really like a tool
for keeping up with my crypto wallets. This is not a tool I would recommend any
one use seriously, as eventually there could be security implications that I am
not qualified to handle properly.

## Features

* [ ] Storage backed by a local sqlite database
* [ ] Manual input of transactions and exchange rates for any number of currencies
* [ ] Handles currencies that are valued in terms of other currencies
* [ ] Calculate sum of wallet values in different currencies
* [ ] Calculate ROI
* [ ] Calculate change in value per day(s)
* [ ] Calculate average ROI/day, and other statistics
* [ ] Predict future wallet value using different fitting methods
* [ ] Calculate speculative statistics based on desired buy and sell limits
* [ ] Handle USD deposited or withdrawn at arbitrary times
* [ ] Display charts of different values over time
* [ ] Query currency values, at current time and closing values per day
* [ ] Store your wallet IDs protected by 2FA
